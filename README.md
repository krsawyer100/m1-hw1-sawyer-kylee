## About Me ##
Hello, my name is Kylee. I am a recent graduate of North Carolina State University from their Design Studies undergraduate program. One of my favorite things to do is spend time with animals, especially my cat Marlee. Marlee is a 15 year old senior cat that I have had since I was seven years old.

## Past Coding Experience ##
During the summer of 2022, I took a coding basics course through DevMountain. In the course, I learned a little bit of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Career Goals ##

1. Learn more about effective design layouts and design technical skills such as coding
2. Learn how to use programs that are used in the design industry such as wordpress, the Adobe creative suite, Figma, Sketch, etc.
3. Take my new skills and practice them by creating portfolio projects focusing on their applications to UX/UI Design
4. Become a UX/UI Designer
